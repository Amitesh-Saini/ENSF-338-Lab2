1. To find the room based on the sign, the algorithm I would use is go to the path on the left and walk down the hallway checking the each room until I find EY128.
2. it will require a 15 steps if we follow the algorithm and go left. Steps in this case is checking the rooms numbers. 
3. This is worst case scenario because it would require a lot of steps.
4. worst case is going left and it's all the way around because it requires the max amount of steps, and best case scenario would be going left and it's the first room you find. 
5. I would make it so I go directly to EY128 without checking the rooms in between.
